# sg-bucket

This repo contains the interfaces and common code related to Sync Gateway buckets.

The Sync Gateway code and concrete bucket implementations ([walrus](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/walrus), [forestdb-bucket](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/forestdb-bucket/)) depend on the this repo.

## Not in use yet

There is an outstanding [Sync Gateway ticket](https://github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway/issues/855) to refactor Sync Gateway and all concrete bucket implementations
